A basic example on how to use selectize.js (for better understanding)

## I was trying to figure out how to use selectize.js with Larvel and rtconnter tagging

"Options: the list of objects to display. Each object must have a property with an unique value to identify the option; the property name is defined by the valueField setting. Option objects must also have a property with the label to display (as tag, in the drop down, etc.); the property name is defined by the labelField setting. The options can have other properties, ignored, unless referenced by other settings, like sortField or searchField."
