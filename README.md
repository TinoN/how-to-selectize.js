    - Basic question: **How to display existing tags and modify them**
    [testlink](laravel-app.js-example/app.js)

## I was trying to figure out how to use [selectize.js](https://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/) with Laravel and [rtconner tagging](https://github.com/rtconner/laravel-tagging)
[Tutorial example: How to add tagging to laravel](https://laravel-news.com/how-to-add-tagging-to-your-laravel-app)

    - Couldn't figure out how selectize.js actually works
    - Created some HTML docs to help me remember next time
